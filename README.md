# :computer: Algorithm and Data Structures 1
This repository contains the code, simulations, activities, and studies from the Algorithm and Data Structures 1 course offered by the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. The objective of this course is to introduce fundamental concepts of algorithms and data structures and to present the Go programming language.

## :books: About the Course
The Algorithm and Data Structures 1 course aims to teach students the fundamentals of programming and computer science. Throughout the course, topics such as linear data structures (arrays, lists, stacks, and queues), non-linear data structures (trees, graphs), search and sorting algorithms, among others, will be covered.

The course also aims to introduce the Go programming language, which is a modern, efficient, and safe language developed by Google.

## :pencil: Topics Covered
During the course, students will learn about a variety of topics, including:

- Linear data structures: Lists, queues, and stacks.
- Search algorithms: Sequential search and binary search.
- Sorting algorithms: Bubble-Sort, Selection-Sort, Insertion-Sort, Quick-Sort, Merge-Sort, Linear Sorting.
- Binary trees: Properties and traversal.
- Search trees: Insertion, Removal, and Search operations.
- Balanced trees: AVL trees.
- Hash tables: Hashing and collision resolution.
- Heaps.

## :file_folder: Using the Code and Simulations
To use the code and simulations available in this repository, you need to have Go installed on your machine. Additionally, programming knowledge in the Go language is required.

To execute a code or simulation, simply navigate to the corresponding folder and run the command `go run filename.go` in the terminal. Then, follow the instructions provided in the README file of the folder to execute the desired code or simulation.
